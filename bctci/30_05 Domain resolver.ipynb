    "You manage a shared web hosting server with multiple IP addresses, and where multiple domains can share the same IP address. Each domain can have multiple subdomains. Implement a class, `DomainResolver`, that supports three methods:\n",

    "1. `register_domain(ip, domain)`: associates a domain with an IP. You can assume that this function will be called at most once for a given domain.\n",
    "2. `register_subdomain(domain, subdomain)`: adds a subdomain to a domain. You can assume that the domain will have been previously registered. Different domains can have a subdomain with the same name.\n",
    "3. `has_subdomain(ip, domain, subdomain)`: returns whether there is a domain registered at that IP that has the given subdomain.\n",
