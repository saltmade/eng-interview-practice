    "You are given an array of letters `arr`, and a string `word`. We know that `word` appears within `arr` as a *subsequence* (its letters appear in order, though not necessarily contiguously). Identify the earliest occurence of the `word` in `arr`, and move all those letters, in order, to the end of `arr`. You must do this in-place, using only `O(1)` extra space, and preserve the relative order of botht he moved letters and the remaining letters"
