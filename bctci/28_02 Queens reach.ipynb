    "Imagine a board has a number of queens in it and no other pieces. We are given an `n x n` binary grid `board`, where `n > 0`, a `0` denotes an empty cell, and a `1` indicates a queen. Return a binary board with the same dimensions, where a `0` denotes that a cell is safe, and a `1` denotes that a cell is not safe. We say a cell is *safe* if there isn't a queen in it and no queen on the board can reach it in a single move."
