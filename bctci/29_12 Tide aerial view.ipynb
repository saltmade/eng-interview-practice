    "You are provided a series of aerial-view pictures of the same coastal region, taken a few minutes apart from each other around the time the tide rises. Each picture consists of an `n x n` binary grid, where `0` represents a part of the region above water, and `1` represents a part below water.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tide appears from the left side and rises toward the right, so, in each picture, for each row, all the 1's will be before all the 0's.\n",
    "- Once a region is under water, it stays under water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine which picture shows the most even balance between regions above and below water (i.e., where the number of 1's most closely equals the number of 0's). In the event of a tie, return the earliest picture."
